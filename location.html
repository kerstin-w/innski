                    <p>If you're looking for a true freeride paradise in the Alps that is also quickly accessible from a
                        major city, you should put Innsbruck at the top of your list. The Tyrolean capital is the
                        perfect starting point for eventful freeride days.</p>
                    <p>
                        With the Nordkette, Axamer Lizum, K端htai and the Stubai Glacier, four winter sports areas can be
                        reached within 45 minutes by public transport. The best thing is that they are all totally
                        different and offer a wide range of terrain from steep gullies above the city to high alpine
                        glacier runs.</p>

                            <h2>Axamer Lizum</h2>
                            <p>From December until April, optimal conditions prevail in the freeride hotspot Axamer
                                Lizum. The winter sports area is located just 19 kilometers from Innsbruck and is served
                                by the free ski bus. Here you are spoiled for choice, with 300 hectares of freeride
                                terrain at your disposal. A large part of it is snow-sure north-facing slopes at over
                                2,000 meters, so powder fun is virtually guaranteed until April.</p>

                            <p>Powder lovers can always discover new slopes of fresh snow on the Stubai Glacier,
                                Austria's largest glacier ski area. A total of 12 freeride runs for all skill levels
                                lead off-piste into the valley. The promising names such as "Cannonball", "Hard Rock" or
                                "Thriller Flake" already speak volumes. Adrenaline rushes are guaranteed on the rides.
                                And thanks to the snow-sure location at over 3,000 meters, skiing fun is theoretically
                                even possible from October to June. </p>

                            <p>Snow-assured, sun-kissed, a powder paradise: It only takes 45 minutes from Innsbruck to
                                the mountain village of K端htai at 2020 meters. Up here, the deep snow slopes reach right
                                up to your front door - it doesn't get much more comfortable than that. Since the entire
                                ski area lies above the timberline, you can ski everywhere off-piste. There is a
                                designated and quite attractive route only under the Kaiserbahn.</p>

                            <p>The view of the city of Innsbruck and the surrounding mountains is nothing short of
                                breathtaking in sunny weather. The heart really starts beating fast on the ride through
                                the Hafelekarrinne, which is one of the steepest ski routes in Europe with a gradient of
                                70 percent and should really only be tackled by experts. A difference in altitude of
                                1,500 meters up to Hungerburg also demands a lot from experienced freeriders.</p>
