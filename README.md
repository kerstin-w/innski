### <a name="colour-palette">Colour Palette</a>

A simple color palette was chosen to reflect the colours of winter and echo the theme of the site. The colours white and dark gray provide a good contrast and the yellow serves to accentuate. The main colours are also present in the imagery and thus perfectly match the design of the site.

### <a name="fonts">Fonts</a> 

[*Sourced via Google Fonts.*](https://fonts.google.com/) 

**Headings:**  "Righteous" Is a modern and more juvenile font that stands out well as a heading and yet is not too distracting and is well readable. Initially I had chosen "Epilogue", but in later stages I found this font too simple and decided to use a font that is more distinctive. 

**Body:** “Roboto”. This font pairs well with Headings and is modern, clean and easy to read. 

### <a name="images">Images</a>

Images are an important aspect of the site, as they should put the user in a winter mood and convey the outdoorsy feeling. Thereby it is easier for the user to get engaged with freeride skiing, regardless of the season or location. 

* A scenic winter image was chosen as a background on each page. 

* The homepage features a picture gallery with impressions of Innsbruck and Freeride Skiing. 

* For each location a picture from that location was added which gives the user an insight into the area.

 Changes to original wireframes:
 * Added a backgroundcolor to text elements that were on top of a background image to make them clearer to read.

 * On the homepage I changed the text for the hero banner to be centered.
